# osint-site
An updatable compendium of useful open-source intelligence sources worldwide

// in progress!

11/26 Next Task:
    Redesign Log in Page to show errors
    Check to see if you want to re-arrange location of auth functions
    Implement Edit Buttons (only show them if a user has additional privilege - maybe this is something I leave as a function done by the admin of the database)
    Walk through Project: Members Only and add assignment features to this site [then mark as done]
    Deploy
